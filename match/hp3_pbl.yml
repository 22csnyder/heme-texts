# Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic and normochromic red blood cells. Leukocytes are normal in number and predominantly normal in morphology. No significant population of circulating blasts or atypical lymphoid cells identified. Platelets are normal in number and predominantly normal in morphology.

# Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic/macrocytic/microcytic anemia with anisocytosis/anisopoikilocytosis. Leukocytes are mildly/moderately/markedly decreased with absolute neutropenia. No significant population of circulating blasts or atypical lymphoid cells identified. Platelets are mildly/moderately/markedly decreased and predominantly normal in morphology/include larger forms.
