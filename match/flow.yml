# Specimen quality:
# Flow cytometry identifies an immunophenotypically abnormal B-cell population consistent with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia immunophenotype comprising % of total cellular events. Of the CD19+ B-lymphoid cells, % have increased forward scatter characteristics indicative of larger cell volume or size.
# Antigens expressed are: 
# Antigens not expressed are:
# CD3+ T-lymphocytes show no pan T cell antigen aberrancies and have a CD4 to CD8 ratio within normal limits. Natural killer cells are not increased. Plasma cells are not overtly increased. No significant CD45 dim population is identified. CD34+ blasts are not increased.
# This immunophenotype is most consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). However, a definitive diagnosis of CLL/SLL using current WHO criteria requires the demonstration of disease related clinical and laboratory findings and/or the presence of >5,000 neoplastic cells per microliter in the peripheral blood. Therefore, correlation with morphology (if submitted), clinical, laboratory, and genetic data is recommended for final diagnosis and classification.
# A Wright-Giemsa stained cytospin from the flow cytometry specimen was examined for internal quality control purposes.
