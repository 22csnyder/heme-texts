#cluster of differentiation
# maybe I can avoid holding shift key so often and save my pinky finger
# also, a good medium to organize & operationalize knowledge

#Notes
## first try at cd and marker regex
## much needs tested

# - I started using "left_word" because "," doesnt count as a word boundary

#NOTE - it's sufficient to send cd# on left_word to CD# with # being a SINGLE digit, 
# so CD235 becomes CD2 then type 35
