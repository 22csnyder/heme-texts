#cluster of differentiation
# maybe I can avoid holding shift key so often and save my pinky finger
# also, a good medium to organize & operationalize knowledge

#Notes
## first try at cd and marker regex
## much needs tested

# - I started using "left_word" because "," doesnt count as a word boundary

#NOTE - it's sufficient to send cd# on left_word to CD# with # being a SINGLE digit, 
# so CD235 becomes CD2 then type 35


matches:

  # Basic CD Formatting
  # Examples
  #   eeecd45eee
  #   CD45eee
  #   eeeCD45
  - regex: "(?i)cd79"
    replace: "CD79a"


  - regex: "\\bcd(?P<number>\\d+)\\b"
    replace: "CD{{number}}"
    label: "Convert cd# to CD# format"
    
    # Usage examples:
    # cd13   --> CD13
    # (s)cd3   --> (s)CD3
    # (cy)CD79a  --> (cy)CD79a

    #core concept <-- fixes asap after first numeral

    # Usage examples:
    # cd79   --> CD79
    # cd79a  --> CD79a
    # cd79b  --> CD79b


  #   # Yes! as long as you make sure "(" and ")" are in default.yml as word_separators: variable

  # - trigger: cd13
  #   replace: CD13
  #   word: true
  #   # testing ()

  # - trigger: "cd45:"
  #   replace: "{{output}}"
  #   vars:
