      immunoblasts possess a 
      large round nucleus with 
      basophilic cytoplasm, variably vacuolated.
      immunoblasts are actively dividing 
          (ki-67 is positive in 90% of cells),

      immunoblasts show positivitiy for 
      B-cell activation markers (CD19,CD20,CD38) as well as 
      CD138 as they differentiate into plasma cells

      immunoblasts can be seen in Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) or 
      Burkitt lymphoma (BL)
