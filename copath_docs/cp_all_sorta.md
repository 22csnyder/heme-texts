Normal B, T and myeloid immunophenotypes using CLEARLLAB tubes combinations of B-cell, T-cell, M1 and M2 or B-cell and T-cell
Can use for a normal BM, PB, fluid or LN normal
Specimen quality:
Flow cytometry analysis shows the CD45 dim-gated events are % of overall cellularity of the specimen, with a subset positive for expression of CD34 and CD117.  Monocyte-gated events account for % of overall cellularity and express CD13, CD33, CD64, and CD14.  Lymphocyte-gated events account for % of the overall cellularity and include a small polytypic CD19+CD20+ B-cell population (% of lymphocytes) with no significant co-expression of CD5 or CD10.  CD3+ T-cells (comprising % of lymphocytes) show no significant loss of pan T-cell antigens and have a CD4 to CD8 ratio within normal limits. There is a small population of CD56+ events (% of lymphocytes) consistent with natural killer cells. There is no overt increase in CD38+ plasma cells.
Correlation with morphology (if submitted), clinical and laboratory data is recommended. A malignant process cannot be excluded solely on the basis of this assay.
