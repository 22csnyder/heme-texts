p53 Immunohistochemistry (should be used for IHC of p53 as a surrogate for mutational status)  p53IHC
p53 immunohistochemistry is a rapid surrogate marker for TP53 gene mutation status.  Studies performed in our laboratory demonstrate that TP53 staining in => 20% of cells has an 86% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detection of TP53 mutation(s).  It is recommended that immunohistochemical results be confirmed by DNA sequencing.
