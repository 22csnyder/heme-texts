CoPath Templates for Peripheral Blood Morphology:
These templates are designed to assist in the formatting and description of the peripheral blood (PB) morphology for PB flow cytometry cases.  These cases include both flow cytometry findings and a morphology interpretation to provide a comprehensive PB diagnosis.  Please put this in the Microscopic Description of your CoPath case and fill in accordingly.
The quicktext code to use in CoPath is indicated in RED text.

Normal pbnormal
CBC data from [date] shows WBC-X K/cumm, hemoglobin-X g/dL, hematocrit-X%, platelets-X K/cumm, MCV-X fL, RDW CV-X%.
Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic and normochromic red blood cells. Leukocytes are normal in number and predominantly normal in morphology. No significant population of circulating blasts or atypical lymphoid cells identified. Platelets are normal in number and predominantly normal in morphology.

CLL pbcll
CBC data from [date] shows WBC-X K/cumm, hemoglobin-X g/dL, hematocrit-X%, platelets-X K/cumm, MCV-X fL, RDW CV-X%.
Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic RBCs/anemia with anisocytosis/anisopoikilocytosis.  Leukocytes are normal/increased in number with absolute/relative lymphocytosis composed predominantly of small mature-appearing lymphocytes with round nuclear contours, condensed chromatin and indistinct nucleoli. Scattered prolymphocytes are present but not significantly increased. Smudge cells are present. Platelets are normal/decreased in number and predominantly normal in morphology.

Pancytopenia pbpancytopenia
CBC data from [date] shows WBC-X K/cumm, hemoglobin-X g/dL, hematocrit-X%, platelets-X K/cumm, MCV-X fL, RDW CV-X%.
Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic/macrocytic/microcytic anemia with anisocytosis/anisopoikilocytosis. Leukocytes are mildly/moderately/markedly decreased with absolute neutropenia. No significant population of circulating blasts or atypical lymphoid cells identified. Platelets are mildly/moderately/markedly decreased and predominantly normal in morphology/include larger forms.

Myeloid left-shift pbleftshift
CBC data from [date] shows WBC-X K/cumm, hemoglobin-X g/dL, hematocrit-X%, platelets-X K/cumm, MCV-X fL, RDW CV-X%.
Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic RBCs/anemia with anisocytosis/anisopoikilocytosis.  Leukocytes are normal/increased in number with relative/absolute neutrophila and myeloid left-shift including occasional blasts/with no significant blast population identified. Platelets are normal/increased/decreased in number and predominantly normal in morphology.

Microscopic examination of the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear shows normocytic/macrocytic/microcytic RBCs/anemia with anisocytosis/anisopoikilocytosis. Leukocytes are normal/increased/decreased in number with absolute/relative lymphocytosis including larger atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclear contours. Platelets are normal/increased/decreased in number and predominantly normal in morphology/include larger forms.
